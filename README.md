PHP-Radio
=========
PHP Radio Stations Database is a simple, yet unique code which allows users to discover new radio stations around the world. They can find stations by their favourite genre, by the country they are from, or even random radios. The script is easy to install/configure, the only things in order to run it are a server with PHP5, cUrl(), mod_rewrite and a Dirble API key.
